            <br>My name is Maleunda Robert Asende,
            <br>
            Student number is s3981357.
            <br>
             Student email address is s3981357@student.rmit.edu.au.
            <br>
</p>
           <p> I am a Congolese and a Christian; I do not miss the church service; married and am a father of 5 kids. I eat Ugali as the main food. In our culture, we do celebrate marriage, and we gather at the place of a bereaved person when someone is passed away. We do bury the body of a dead person, and it is against our norms and customs to cremate someone. I have done my primary school and secondary school in the refugee camp in Tanzania, and here in Australia, I have done a certificate ii in pre-vocation Automotive and a certificate iii in individual support. I have also completed a diploma in criminology and criminal justice and a diploma in nursing. I speak English, Swahili and French. I am adept at handling different tasks competently under pressure. I enjoy travelling and watching football, and in my free time, I do play the guitar as my hobby. 
           
          </p>


<h3>   Interest in IT</h3>

<p>


  The media, technology worldwide, smartphones, and computers everywhere shape the interest and the eagerness to know and understand information technology. 

  The best motivation was based on the fact that every day due to the world of technology, I have to use a mobile phone, and I will spend hours browsing websites and staying online watching different videos on youtube and Facebook. 
  
  All the time I have spent online watching different videos, I did not get any certificates or diplomas; it was just a waste of time. Then, I decided to study and become a web and game developer. Studying at RMIT university was just a coincidence of time as I applied through Open University Australia, and they decided to enrol me at RMIT university. I did not see any problem with that because all I wanted was to be enrolled and start studying to gain knowledge in the IT industry. Once I complete my program and graduate, I want to work as a freelancer because I enjoy being the boss of my own.
  I look forward to studying anything and everything about web and game development throughout my studies.

                                      I had to take some considerations after the release of these results as, according to Myers-Briggs, the personality result was a protagonist. They explain that these types of personalities are characterised by thoughtful and idealism for a positive impact on other peoples’ life. As for the Education planner result, my good learning styles are auditory and visual, which is true as I learn faster when I hear and I can see the materials. And finally, according to the creativity test, I scored 52.72, which was good, and I like to work on my persistence, boldness, perspective and the overall rest of the creativity result.

                                      I will consider these results as a mirror that will guide and remind me of what I need to do and behave in a given team. I will be able to adjust myself to achieve the desired result in a team and make sure that I do participate fully in a team to gain different knowledge from different people. I will always refer back to these results for me to engage and adhere to the common purpose and follow the rules of the team for a good achievement of the team.

                                      • How should you take this into account when forming a team?
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                      
                                      It is good to remember that no one knows more than anyone else in a given team; also, it is of good purpose that the intention of forming a team is to help each other and those who are advanced in certain areas to uplift others who have no clue in such areas. So, when constituting a group, I will need to understand my weaknesses and always remind myself of the importance of creating it, making the team a good environment of learning, and understanding and tolerate each whenever possible for good advancement.

<h3>Project Idea</h3>


<p>My Project: Create a QR tracker code for motorbike drivers and Taxi drivers to prevent stealing and murder.</p>


<p>The quick response tracker will contain information about the motorbikes and Taxis, such as the Vehicle Identification Number, the area it operates, the information of the owner, the driver or rider, and tarck the Taxi or motorbike when it is on the road and off.</p>

<p>Considering riding motorbikes and driving taxis is the primary income source for the young African generation. The idea of creating the QR tracker code for motorbike riders and taxi drivers is based on some worse situations in the past and still happening in some rural and urban areas in most African countries. Driving and riding overnight has been a problem and costs the life of some taxi drivers and motorbike riders in Africa. The idea is to store data of Taxis and motorbikes that will start using our QR tracker technology. Using our QR tracker will help us track and get the information as quickly as possible whenever they get a customer to take somewhere while on the road and when they have arrived at their destination. </p> 

The QR tracker code will be able to: 
<p>
            <ul>
                   
                  <li>Scan the image of the customer, </li>
                  <li>Locate the local police station in the area,</li>
                  <li>Locate the motorbike or Taxi wherever it is,</li>
                  <li>The mileage it has done from the station, </li>
                  <li>Know when they are on the road and when they are off,</li>
                  <li>Get quick information as soon as possible,</li>
                  <li>In the situation of delay or missing, be able to alert the police and other security agencies.</li>

                </ul>

  </p>
<p>

  The idea is of great significance as it will minimise the incidences of robbery and killings of drivers and riders. The police and the local community members have reported incidences of robbery and death of taxi drivers and motorbike riders. These incidences mostly happen at night when people will hire a Taxi or a motorbike thinking they are good customers, but at the end of their journey they will strangle the driver or rider and throw his body near the road or in the bush and rob his Taxi or his motorbike.
  The family will start looking for their loved one and report to the police the missing person; it could take hours or days to locate where the person is. It will be too difficult to locate the body of the missing person thrown in the bush, which can take days, but for those left near the road, it will be easy to find their bodies as the information will spread quickly. The system of QR tracker codes will help the drivers and the riders to carry on their daily activities with no fear and increase their income on a daily basis. 
  

  </p>

  Motorbike riders in most cities of Africa, such as Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, scare to ride at night-time for fear of being robbed and killed. Some riders ride overnight in pairs, one motorbike will carry the customer, and the other one will follow them behind for security measures which cost financially as rather than using one motorbike, they use two where they could save money for fuel and service for the other motorbike.

  There are many awful situations of the murder of motorbike riders and taxi drivers, which have been reported to the police in several countries.
  
</p>


Example:
<br>
1)  In 2019, in Kampala/Uganda, a place called Mango, two men hired a motorbike, and when they arrived at the place where they planned to rob that motorbike, one strangled the rider, and another one went to take the hummer from the place where they have hidden it and started to hit the rider on his head until he died, all this horrific event the CCTV camera captured it.

2)   In 2019 in Tanzania, angry local community members captured three men robbers of motorbikes, and they started to beat and hit them with rocks until they died.
    <br>Ndevu Sangali. (2019, April 21). 

</p>

<p>


  The problem I am facing is my overall knowledge vis a vis the understanding of information technology as it is a new field to me and I feel lost in most cases with the materials. The question is how to create a website and develop a smartphone app which will incorporate the fully functional requirements for the QR tracker code that I am planning to create on a standard level. 


</p>

<p>


  
  
  <br>
  <br>
  As I would like to start from scratch on this project on a small level, I will need to know a basic understanding of the HTML code as it is the main computer language used to create the website. I will need to know how to edit images for an eye-catch visual on my site and also use different software such as Adobe Flash Professional to add flash videos, animation and interactive presentations to improve the experience of people visiting my site. So, after I have created my website on my computer, I will need to upload it to a web hosting service such as Github, Free FTP or File Zilla. Creating a website is an ongoing process, and I will need to use Google Analytics and open web analytics to allow me to identify how visitors engage with my website. I will need to test my website on different browsers to make sure it is as I wanted it to be and that it works nicely.

<p>

  In conclusion, The creation of this website and QR tracker code in a smartphone app will be a game changer on the road. Motorbike riders and Taxi drivers in most cities of Africa, particularly in Dar es Salaam/Tanzania, as an area of our first trial, will be able to do their everyday business overnight without interruption and fear. 
  As overnight, they work in pairs, but the implementation of this QR tracker code will enable everyone to do his job alone rather than working in pairs. They will be getting alerts on how to access the police service at the nearest station and other security agencies in case of suspicious customers.
